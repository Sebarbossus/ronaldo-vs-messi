# Ronaldo vs. Messi
Since I like football (soccer) I decided I would make a page comparing the best two
football players in the world, at least of modern football. 

I also implemented a cool feature with JavaScript that changes the background image depending on the time of the day.
From 0 to 12 AM the image of the Real Madrid stadium (Santiago Bernabeu) will be
displayed, while the image of FC Barcelona's stadium (Camp Nou) will display
during the rest of the day.

This page is mobile responsive.

#### You can see the page live [here](https://sebarbossus.github.io/ronaldo-vs-messi/).
